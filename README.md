# Multiplayer helicopter training mission

There are a few pickups in the North East islands that Have some AA guns, 
these have been placed so they should not be able to fire down between the island only out over the tops of them. so keep your heads down :)

A lot of the LZ's have been set up to practice landing in areas that have been cleared by a daisy cutter so they will be quite tight.

There are 3 airports set up with helicopters and jets, you can use the map board at each sight to fast travel using the scroll wheel option. 
FSB Berchtesgaden is also on the fast travel option if you want to practice/play with any of the artillery in the game.

Zeus access has also been granted to the first 4 players.

This a a conversion of sigmar male grindset which was in turn a conversion/combination of other scenarios as per below.

Multiplayer conversion (and almost complete rewrite on the script side) of [Wibblers mission][wbmp].

Probably will not run as singplayer scenario at all but that doesn't matter, just host a LAN game even if you're the only one playing.

Also includes code borrowed from [Kylania][kex].
